# Bootable Pong Game

This is a personal project I created in mid 2010 to teach myself x86 assembly.
It is a bootable pong game which runs without an operating system. It relies on legacy BIOS features and may not work properly on modern machines, but as of writing this it still runs fine on QEMU.

## Requirements

* [NASM](https://www.nasm.us/) (Netwide Assembler)
* [QEMU](https://www.qemu.org/) or equivalent to run it
